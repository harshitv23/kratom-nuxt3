                        Southeast Asia. The leaves from these trees are <a href="/how-is-kratom-grown-and-produced">dried
                            and ground into a fine powder</a>, which can be used as is or in capsule form.</p>

                    <p>Different strains of kratom are produced based on how the trees are grown and when the leaves are
                        harvested. These strains can be identified by their color and place of origin, and have unique
                        physical and physiological effects.</p>

                    <p>Discovering the right kratom strain for you requires understanding the different strains and their
                        effects. However, personal experience is the best way to determine the best strain for your needs.

                    <h2>The 3 Main Strains of Kratom</h2>
                    <p>The most important kratom strain characteristic is the strain’s color: white, green, or red.</p>

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may see differently-named strains of kratom outside of these
                            three varieties, but when the types are broken down any further, it usually refers to where the
                            leaves for different kratom strains were sourced from, rather than a difference in the intrinsic
                            properties and preparation of a particular type of kratom (with the exception of

                    <p><a href="/white-vein-kratom"><span style="font-weight: 400;">White kratom</span></a><span
                            style="font-weight: 400;"> is harvested from young kratom trees, and it is prized by those
                            seeking an uplifting kratom experience. Its intensity makes it harder for beginners to
                            appreciate, but it can be rewarding for those who are interested in and have tried other types
                            of kratom.</span>

                            be harvested while the leaves of the kratom tree are still young and the veins are white
                            (similarly to how </span><a href="/the-types-of-teas-a-beginners-guide-to-tea-pairings"><span

                            harvested from younger tea leaves). After harvesting, the leaves are dried entirely indoors with
                            no light on them.</span></p>

                    <p><b>Potency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Because it is harvested at the earliest stage, white
                            vein kratom has the highest <a

                            content of any strain (except for Maeng Da). As such, white vein may be unusually potent, and
                            new users may consider trying a green vein strain first.</span></p>

                    <p><b>Effects</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: White kratom is said to have a mild stimulant effect.

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most popular strains of kratom, </span><a

                            style="font-weight: 400;"> is best used for its supposed sedative effects. It is harvested from
                            the most mature kratom trees and has the highest 7-hydroxymitragynine content.</span></p>

                    <p><b>Features</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><a
                            href="/what-is-red-vein-kratom-and-where-does-it-come-from"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Red
                                kratom leaves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are processed using lots of
                            sunlight or a UV lamp during the drying process. Red kratom may also be fermented during its
                            processing to create bentuangie kratom, a slightly different variation on the standard red
                            kratom (more info on bentuangie below).</span></p>

                    <p><b>Potency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Red kratom is the most mellow of the major kratom
                            strains, and is not generally classified as a stimulant. This makes it more approachable than
                            its white or green counterparts.</span></p>

                    <p><b>Effects</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Red kratom is thought to have a mild sedative effect,
                            helping the user to remain calm. Some people claim red strain is the best kratom for pain
                            relief, although it has not been approved for this use or as a substitute for any
                            medication.</span></p>

                            style="font-weight: 400;"> is the middle road option between white and red. It is said to offer
                            similar stimulant effects to those of white kratom and is harvested in the middle stage of the
                            kratom tree’s life cycle.</span></p>

                    <p><b>Features</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><a

                            typically dried indoors at first, often in an air-conditioned room, then moved outside to finish
                            the drying process.</span></p>

                    <p><b>Potency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Green kratom has a more subtle effect than its white
                            vein counterpart, but is still regarded as a stimulant.</span></p>

                    <p><b>Effects</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: As a stimulant, </span><a

                    <h2>Other Types and Kratom Varieties</h2>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three major kratom strains are split up by the kinds of effects
                            that they have on the user. However, there are still other kratom varieties within these three
                            main categories. </span><a href="/4-popular-varieties-of-kratom"><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">Other popular kratom varieties</span></a><span
                            style="font-weight: 400;"> will present a variation of one of the major three, or sometimes a
                            blend of two or more different kratom strains, boasting more subtle differences such as
                            increased potency or a longer-lasting effect.</span></p>
                    <h3><b>Maeng Da Kratom</b></h3>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maeng Da refers to a variety of kratom that was originally grown in
                            Thailand (though growers now replicate the farming practices to grow Maeng Da varieties
                            elsewhere). Maeng Da is carefully curated to be of particularly high quality and potency. Maeng
                            Da varieties may be classified and marketed as both red and white kratom, as Maeng Da has a
                            characteristic blend of the traits of </span><a href="/red-maeng-da"><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">red vein</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a

                            this variety may use it to relieve intense pain. Bentuangie kratom is said to be the best kratom

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the three main strains of kratom, yellow vein kratom is named
                            after a color, though this name does not derive from a specific leaf. In truth, it is not a
                            distinct kratom strain by itself. Instead, it is likely that yellow kratom is produced when two
                            strains of kratom (such as white and green or green and red) are mixed together. The yellow name
                            refers to this blending of other colored strains of kratom.</span></p>

                    <h3>Varieties Named for Their Source</h3>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many other major kratom varieties are named after their source. So,
                            for example, </span><a href="/white-vein-borneo-kratom"><span style="font-weight: 400;">White
                                Borneo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a white kratom from the island of
                            Borneo, while </span><a href="/bali-red-vein-kratom-powder"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Red
                                Bali</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a red kratom from Bali, an island in
                            Indonesia.</span></p>

                    <p>Different regional strains of kratom change the <a
                            href="https://kratomspot.com/kratom-alkaloids-what-you-need-to-know">alkaloid profile</a> of
                        the resulting strain and, as a result, the effects users will experience. However, the region will
                        not have as significant impact as the other factors described above.</p>
